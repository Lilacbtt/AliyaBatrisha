            <p>During my internship at Kent Soon Recycle Centre, I had the opportunity to work in the administrative department. My responsibilities included filing important documents, managing the GPS system, and updating Excel worksheets. I worked alongside a small, close-knit team consisting of four administrative staff, including myself, and two accountant executives. My officemates were friendly, kindhearted, caring, and hardworking individuals who made the work environment comfortable and supportive. Throughout my internship, I gained valuable work skills, improved my communication abilities, and learned the importance of discipline in the workplace. I felt both happy and grateful for this experience, as it helped me grow professionally and personally.</p>
